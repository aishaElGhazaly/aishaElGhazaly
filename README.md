# Hey, I'm Ash 👋

Computer Engineering grad who likes building things that interest me, whether it’s about the stock market, deep space or music.

Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t, but I always learn something.

Mostly into:
- 🛠️ Software Dev  
- 🧠 Machine Learning  
- ☁️ Cloud (learning + AWS certified!)

Projects happen when I get curious enough. A web app, an ML workflow, or a desktop app.  
**Form doesn’t matter — exploration does.**

## 🧪 Projects

- 🎯 **Stock Price Prediction**
  ML pipeline that forecasts S&P 500 company performance based on **technical** and **fundamental** analysis.  
  Pulled data from **AlphaVantage** + **yfinance**, and used **AutoGluon** to handle feature selection and model optimization.  
  Learned a lot about machine learning and financial markets.

- 🌌 **AstroVision**  
  A desktop app that makes **astronomical data** easy to explore for amateur astronomers.  
  Includes features like object search, Quick previews, FITS file retrievals, composite creation and spectrogram inspection.
  Built with **PyQt5** and **AstroPy**, powered by **SDSS** data. Helped me get better at transforming raw data into usable tools.

## ⚙️ I Code With
- **Python** (main), **C/C++** (for Leetcode), **Java** (a bit rusty), **SQL** (when needed)
- **Libraries I like:** AutoGluon, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools I use the most:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Git (still learning it properly)


## 🚀 Next Up
- Revamping projects  
- Hosting them on AWS  
- Getting better at cloud stuff  
- Making cooler, more complete things

# 👋 Hey, I'm Ash

Computer Engineering grad who likes building things that interest me, whether it’s about the stock market, deep space, or music.

Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t. But I always learn something.


## 💻 What I Like Working On

- 🛠️ Software Dev  
- 🧠 Machine Learning  
- ☁️ Cloud (learning + AWS certified!)

Projects happen when I get curious enough. A web app, an ML workflow, or a desktop app.  

**Form doesn’t matter. Exploration does.**


## 🧪 Projects

### 🎯 Stock Price Prediction  
- ML pipeline that forecasts S&P 500 company performance using **technical** and **fundamental** analysis.  
- Pulled data from **AlphaVantage** and **yfinance**, and used **AutoGluon** for feature selection and model optimization.  
- Learned a lot about machine learning and financial markets.

### 🌌 [AstroVision](https://github.com/aishaElGhazaly/AstroVision)  
- A desktop app that makes **astronomical data** easy to explore for amateur astronomers.  
- Includes object search, previews, FITS file retrievals, composite creation, and spectrogram inspection.  
- Built with **PyQt5** and **AstroPy**, powered by **SDSS** data.  
- Taught me a lot about turning raw data into useful, user-friendly tools.
